# Refactor to Lambdas

**Challenge:** We have a client who uses a command line application.

Users are presented with a menu and asked to select an option. 

If an invalid option is received, the user is alerted as to why the option is invalid, and re-prompted. 

Refactor the code so that the duplication is removed by the use of lambdas.

### Set up

This is a gradle project and can be imported into an IDE or built using the command line.

### Tests

All tests can be run through an IDE or on the command line with the command `gradle test`
